          My Journey
         </h3>
          <p>
The one thing I have always enjoyed doing is singing operatic music since I was a 
little kid. <b>My dream is to be a successful opera singer just like my private teacher.</b>
My teacher has and always will be my role model. This may have sounded like an
absurd dream especially for a kid, but that kid is still going at it and is about to 
audition for the next steps to accomplish this dream. I listen to this music every
day and it still hits me the same way emotionally just as it did when i first heard
it. That's what opera is supposed to do. It's supposed to hit you emotionally and I
want to do that for others as well. Operas and arias that I want to sing in are:</p>
     <ul>
    <li>La boh√®me</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Che ghelida manina</li>
       </ul>
       <li>La Traviata</li>
    <li>Rigoletto</li>
    <li>Turandot</li>
    <li>Tosca</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>College!</b></p>
         </h4>
         <p> Something that really came in handy in recent years was my 8 years of experience of 
piano. That's because learning basically any instrument helps with theory and learning
the basics of music. However, I've hit a wall in my progress which is why I'm pursuing
opera in college. I want to improve and get help to get through this wall thats
stunting my progress. So my first step to getting through this wall is to hit the
auditions for these amazing colleges. One of those colleges or I should say
conservatories is <em>New England Conservatory</em>. This is definitely one of my
top choices. </p>
