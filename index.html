The one thing I have always enjoyed doing is singing operatic music since I was a 
    little kid. My dream is to be a successful opera singer just like my private teacher.
    My teacher has and always will be my role model. This may have sounded like an
  absurd dream especially for a kid, but that kid is still going at it and is about to 
    audition for the next steps to accomplish this dream. I listen to this music every
    day and it still hits me the same way emotionally just as it did when i first heard
    it. That's what opera is supposed to do. It's supposed to hit you emotionally and I
  want to do that for others as well. Operas that I want to sing in are:</p>

    <li>La Rondine</li>
